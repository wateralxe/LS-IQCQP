# LS-IQCQP
LS-IQCQP is a Local Search solver for Binary QCQP problem.
Local Search is an incomplete algorithm that continuously improves the quality of solutions through a finite number of iterations within a cutoff time. After the cutoff period, it outputs the found optimal objective function value and solution set.






To use the solver,  run ./qpsolver cutoff_time(second) filename.lp. 


The "sonet" folder contains instances for testing.

"run.sh" is a simple example of using the solver.
